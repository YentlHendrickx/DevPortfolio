                Despite my primary interest lying in software, i still have a major fascination towards hardware. I find it amazing how software and hardware, thought distinctly different, can be combined
                to create incredible feats. Whether I'm at my computer working on a software project or engrossed in a hardware-related endeavor, I have a deep respect and love for both of these realms.
