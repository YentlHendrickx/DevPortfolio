		bio: `
                My name is Yentl Hendrickx, I am an Application Development student at Thomas More Geel. 
                I have a passion for programming and try to work on as many cool projects as I can. Even though my main passion is software I am still really interested in hardware.
                Software and Hardware are two whole different worlds but even so, I really enjoy both of them!
                When not tinkering away behind my computer or working on a Hardware related project, you can find me at the gym or hanging out with friends.
                And as if I do not spend enough time behind my computer I am also a gamer and play games fairly often.
